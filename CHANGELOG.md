# CHANGELOG.md

VERSION: 1.0.1
DATE: January 24nd, 2022

+ Uses 0x05 byte for delimiting keys and values instead of an = sign
+ Made delimiter characters a macro so it can be modified at compile time.
+ Added `print_until_delimiter_nl`
+ Findex invoked with no key now defaults to listing all keys

And now, for crazed ramblings..

Nothing new to report.
